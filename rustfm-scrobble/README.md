*rustfm-scrobble* is a [Last.fm Scrobble API 2.0](http://www.last.fm/api/scrobbling) crate for Rust. It allows easy 
acccess to the "scrobble" and "now playing" notification endpoints through a simple Rust API. It can be used to record
song-plays from music players, build analog scrobbling tools similar to [VinylScrobbler](https://vinylscrobbler.com/)
or work with IoT Devices. It was initially built to implement a 
[Spotify scrobbling service](https://github.com/bobbo/spotify-connect-scrobbler) using the 
[Spotify Connect Protocol](https://www.spotify.com/uk/connect/) when the 
[Alexa Spotify client](https://www.spotify.com/uk/amazonalexa/) did not support scrobbling plays to Last.fm.

## Features

* Scrobble songs to Last.fm ('scrobble' API endpoint)
* Publish now-playing song to Last.fm ('now playing' API endpoint)
* Batch scrobble support in `Scrobbler::scrobble_batch` and `ScrobbleBatch`
* Multiple authentication flows to gain permissions to publish to Last.fm user profile
    * Store a pre-authenticated session key & throw away secret data after initial authentication
* Simple error handling; each API operation returns a `Result` with a simple `Error` type on failure
* Unit tested
