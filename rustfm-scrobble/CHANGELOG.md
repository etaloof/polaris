    * Deprecate old `authenticate` method

    * Add `Scrobbler::scrobble_batch`
    * Add `ScrobbleBatch` type, auto-generated using `wrapped-vec` crate

Version 0.3.1 - 2017-10-02
==========================

    * Update Scrobbler methods to take Scrobble struct instead of artist &

Version 0.2.1 - 2017-08-26
==========================

    connection pools timing out which broke long-existing Scrobbler instances


Version 0.2.0 - 2017-03-04
==========================

  * Return API responses encoded as structs (Issue #3)
    All Scrobbler methods now return the Last.fm API response deserialized
    into a Rust struct for the type (see API documentation)
  * Add ScrobbleError (with std::err:Error), instead of just returning
    error messages as strings.
  * Refactor Scrobbler/client code:
    * Move request-making code out of Scrobbler and into client; Scrobbler 
      should be an extremely minimal high(est) level layer.

      instead of passing magic strings around.
